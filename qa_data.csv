"Explain normalization in DBMS","Normalization is a database design technique that organizes data to minimize redundancy and dependency. It involves dividing large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them. The main goals are to eliminate data redundancy, ensure data consistency, and improve data integrity. There are several normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF) with increasing levels of normalization.","Database"
"What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?","SQL databases are relational databases that use structured query language and have a predefined schema. They are ACID compliant and best for complex queries and transactions. NoSQL databases are non-relational, have flexible schemas, and are designed for distributed data stores. They are better for handling large amounts of unstructured data and horizontal scaling.","Database"
"Explain REST API principles","REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. Key principles include: 1) Stateless - each request contains all information needed, 2) Client-Server separation, 3) Cacheable responses, 4) Uniform interface with standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), 5) Layered system architecture, 6) Code on demand (optional).","Web Development"
"What is the difference between GET and POST?","GET requests are used to retrieve data and are idempotent (safe to repeat). Data is sent in URL parameters and has length limitations. POST requests are used to submit data to be processed, are not idempotent, send data in request body, and have no length limitations. GET requests can be cached and bookmarked, while POST requests cannot.","Web Development"
"Explain object-oriented programming concepts","OOP is a programming paradigm based on objects. Key concepts include: 1) Encapsulation - bundling data and methods that operate on that data, 2) Inheritance - creating new classes from existing ones, 3) Polymorphism - ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms, 4) Abstraction - hiding complex implementation details.","Programming"
"What is the difference between list and tuple in Python?","Lists are mutable (can be changed after creation) and use square brackets []. Tuples are immutable (cannot be changed after creation) and use parentheses (). Lists are typically used for collections of similar items that may change, while tuples are used for collections of related items that shouldn't change. Tuples are slightly more memory efficient.","Python"
"Explain time complexity and Big O notation","Time complexity measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows with input size. Big O notation describes the worst-case scenario. Common complexities: O(1) - constant time, O(log n) - logarithmic, O(n) - linear, O(n²) - quadratic, O(2ⁿ) - exponential. Space complexity measures memory usage growth.","Algorithms"
"What is a binary search tree?","A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children. For any node, all values in the left subtree are less than the node's value, and all values in the right subtree are greater. This property enables efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations with O(log n) average time complexity.","Data Structures"
"Explain the difference between stack and queue","A stack follows LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle - the last element added is the first one removed. Operations are push (add) and pop (remove). A queue follows FIFO (First In, First Out) principle - the first element added is the first one removed. Operations are enqueue (add) and dequeue (remove).","Data Structures"
"What is dependency injection?","Dependency Injection is a design pattern where dependencies (objects that a class needs) are provided to the class rather than the class creating them itself. This promotes loose coupling, makes code more testable, and follows the dependency inversion principle. It can be implemented through constructor injection, setter injection, or interface injection.","Software Design"
"What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?","HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is unencrypted and sends data in plain text, making it vulnerable to interception. HTTPS (HTTP Secure) uses SSL/TLS encryption to secure data transmission. HTTPS provides authentication, data integrity, and confidentiality. It's essential for secure web applications, especially those handling sensitive information like passwords or payment data.","Web Development"
"Explain the concept of recursion","Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems. It consists of a base case (stopping condition) and a recursive case (function calling itself). Common applications include tree traversal, factorial calculation, and sorting algorithms like quicksort and mergesort.","Algorithms"
"What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?","Synchronous programming executes code sequentially, blocking execution until each operation completes. Asynchronous programming allows operations to run in the background without blocking the main thread. It's useful for I/O operations, API calls, and handling multiple tasks concurrently. JavaScript uses callbacks, promises, and async/await for asynchronous programming.","Programming"
"What is a hash table and how does it work?","A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs using a hash function to map keys to array indices. The hash function converts the key into an index where the value is stored. It provides O(1) average time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups. Collision resolution techniques include chaining and open addressing.","Data Structures"
"Explain the concept of virtual memory","Virtual memory is a memory management technique that allows a computer to use more memory than physically available. It uses a combination of RAM and disk storage, with the operating system managing the mapping between virtual and physical addresses. This enables efficient memory usage and allows programs to run even when physical memory is limited.","Computer Science"
